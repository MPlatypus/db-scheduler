|Question|Answer|
|--------|------|
|What does this library actually do?|This library allows for having timers, or time based events, to keep running, even if the program restarts during the time. This is done in a safe, asynchronous manor as well.|
|What databases does this library support?|This library only supports a few libraries at the moment, but the list will slowly grow and expand, as more are added! If your library does not exist, you can however, create your [own library](./getting_started/custom_database.md).|
